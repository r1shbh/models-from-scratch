# ML/AI Algorithms from scratch in Python (numpy)
My practice playground for implementing the algorithms I come across while studying ML/AI.

## Logistic Regression
LogisticRegression.py
Binary classification (1 layer) model which predicts probability if a sample belongs to a given class or not.
Hyperparametrs used:
- eta: Learning rate
- epochs: Number of iterations of learning
- random_state: Seed for random generator

Cost/Loss function: Log-likelihood

Optimizer: Batch gradient descent

## linear_models:
Consists of codes for LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, Adaline, Perceptron

## LeNet 5 Architecture (CNN)
- Implemented Forward propogation
- User can specify model hyperparameters like: Number of layers, number of nodes, type of layer(dense/conv/pool), learning rate, etc.
--- Still in progress ---
