# models-from-scratch
Implementing different Machine Learning/ Deep Learning models from scratch.

## Logistic Regression
LogisticRegression.py
Binary classification (1 layer) model which predicts probability if a sample belongs to a given class or not.
Hyperparametrs used:
- eta: Learning rate
- epochs: Number of iterations of learning
- random_state: Seed for random generator

Cost/Loss function: Log-likelihood

Optimizer: Batch gradient descent

## LeNet 5 Architecture (CNN)
--- Still in progress ---
